# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipelines are essential for automating the build, test, and deployment processes in modern software development. Tools like **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** play a crucial role in implementing CI/CD pipelines. Let's discuss each of these tools and how they fit into the CI/CD process.

### **1. Jenkins**

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that is widely used for implementing CI/CD pipelines. It allows you to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

#### **1.1. Key Features of Jenkins**
- **Pipeline as Code**: Define CI/CD pipelines using a Jenkinsfile (Groovy-based DSL).
- **Extensibility**: Thousands of plugins available for integrating with other tools (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes).
- **Distributed Builds**: Run builds on multiple nodes for scalability.
- **Integration**: Integrates with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and deployment tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

#### **1.2. Example: Jenkins Pipeline**
A Jenkins pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile` and typically consists of stages like **Build**, **Test**, and **Deploy**.

**Example Jenkinsfile**:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **`agent any`**: Run the pipeline on any available agent.
- **`stages`**: Define the stages of the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
- **`steps`**: Define the commands to execute in each stage.

#### **1.3. Jenkins Plugins**
- **Git Plugin**: Integrates Jenkins with Git for source code management.
- **Docker Plugin**: Allows Jenkins to build and push Docker images.
- **Kubernetes Plugin**: Enables Jenkins to deploy applications to Kubernetes.

### **2. Docker**

**Docker** is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It ensures consistency across different environments by packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

#### **2.1. Key Features of Docker**
- **Containerization**: Package applications and dependencies into containers.
- **Portability**: Run containers on any system that supports Docker.
- **Isolation**: Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring consistency.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast.

#### **2.2. Example: Dockerfile**
A `Dockerfile` defines the steps to build a Docker image.

**Example Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/my-app.jar /app/my-app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-app.jar"]
```

- **`FROM`**: Specifies the base image.
- **`WORKDIR`**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- **`COPY`**: Copies files from the host to the container.
- **`EXPOSE`**: Exposes a port for the container.
- **`CMD`**: Defines the command to run when the container starts.

#### **2.3. Docker Commands**
- **Build an Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
  ```
- **Run a Container**:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:8080 my-app:1.0
  ```
- **Push an Image to Docker Hub**:
  ```bash
  docker push my-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0
  ```

### **3. Kubernetes**

**Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

#### **3.1. Key Features of Kubernetes**
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy applications using declarative configuration files.
- **Scaling**: Automatically scale applications based on demand.
- **Self-Healing**: Restart failed containers and replace unhealthy nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances of an application.

#### **3.2. Example: Kubernetes Deployment**
A Kubernetes deployment is defined in a YAML file.

**Example `deployment.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

- **`replicas`**: Number of instances (pods) to run.
- **`image`**: Docker image to use for the container.
- **`ports`**: Ports to expose on the container.

#### **3.3. Kubernetes Commands**
- **Apply a Deployment**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  ```
- **Get Pods**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- **Scale a Deployment**:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
  ```

### **4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes**

#### **4.1. Pipeline Overview**
1. **Source Code Management**: Jenkins pulls the source code from a Git repository.
2. **Build**: Jenkins builds the application using Maven/Gradle.
3. **Test**: Jenkins runs unit and integration tests.
4. **Package**: Jenkins builds a Docker image and pushes it to a Docker registry.
5. **Deploy**: Jenkins deploys the application to Kubernetes.

#### **4.2. Example Jenkinsfile**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0 .'
            }
        }
        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-creds', usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER', passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS')]) {
                    sh 'echo $DOCKER_PASS | docker login -u $DOCKER_USER --password-stdin'
                    sh 'docker push my-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
