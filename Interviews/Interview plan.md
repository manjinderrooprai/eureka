Here’s a practical step-by-step plan to help you crack upcoming interviews:

⸻

1. Identify Patterns in Past Interviews
	•	What type of questions stumped you? (DSA, System Design, Java internals, frameworks?)
	•	Were the rejections due to coding rounds, tech interviews, or HR/culture fit?

Let’s work on your weak spots.

⸻

2. Core Technical Areas to Master

Java (Advanced Concepts)
	•	Multithreading & Concurrency (ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool, locks)
	•	JVM internals (GC, memory management, class loading)
	•	Java 8–21 features (Streams, Records, Sealed Classes, Virtual Threads)
	•	Serialization, reflection, annotations

Frameworks
	•	Spring, Spring Boot (deep dive into DI, AOP, Security, WebFlux if relevant)
	•	Hibernate/JPA (Lazy/Eager loading, caching, query optimization)

Microservices & System Design
	•	RESTful API design (versioning, pagination, error handling)
	•	Authentication (JWT, OAuth2)
	•	Service Discovery (Eureka, Consul)
	•	Circuit breakers (Resilience4j, Hystrix)
	•	Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
	•	Database design (SQL + NoSQL), indexing, query tuning

DevOps/CI-CD/Cloud (optional but nice to have)
	•	Docker, Kubernetes basics
	•	CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
	•	AWS/GCP (especially EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)

⸻

3. Coding & DSA
	•	Focus on medium-level Leetcode: arrays, strings, trees, dynamic programming, sliding window, backtracking, graphs
	•	Practice for timing and optimality
	•	Use platforms: Leetcode, HackerRank, Codeforces

⸻

4. Mock Interviews + Behavioral Questions
	•	Prepare STAR-based answers (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for:
	•	Handling production issues
	•	Working in a team with conflict
	•	Leading projects or mentoring juniors
	•	Use Pramp or Interviewing.io for mocks

⸻

5. Resume & LinkedIn Check
	•	Tailor resume per job description
	•	Highlight:
	•	Projects using latest Java features
	•	Metrics (e.g., “Reduced API latency by 30%”)
	•	Tech stack clearly

⸻

6. Stay Consistent
	•	Make a weekly prep plan: e.g., 3 days Java, 2 days DSA, 1 day system design
	•	Track mistakes in a Google Doc

⸻

Want me to help you with:
	•	A mock interview?
	•	Java question bank?
	•	A personalized weekly schedule?
Let’s make the next opportunity count. You’ve got this.
