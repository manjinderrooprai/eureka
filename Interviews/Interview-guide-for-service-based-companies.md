## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. The four main principles of OOP are **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**. Let's break them down with examples:

### 1. **Inheritance**
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

**Example**:
```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal class
        myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog class
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `Dog` class inherits the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. This allows `Dog` to reuse the `eat()` method without rewriting it.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved using **access modifiers** like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.

**Example**:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private attribute

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Public method to get balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.deposit(1000); // Accessing public method
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `balance` attribute is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, it is accessed and modified through public methods (`deposit()` and `getBalance()`). This ensures data integrity and control over how the data is modified.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions. There are two types of polymorphism:
   - **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
   - **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

**Example (Method Overriding)**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Animal object
        Animal myDog = new Dog();      // Dog object
        Animal myCat = new Cat();      // Cat object

        myAnimal.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.sound();    // Output: Dog barks
        myCat.sound();    // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `sound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. Even though the reference type is `Animal`, the actual object type determines which `sound()` method is called at runtime.

### 4. **Abstraction**
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

**Example (Using Abstract Class)**:
```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void draw();

    // Concrete method
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

// Concrete class
class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape myShape = new Circle(); // Upcasting
        myShape.draw();  // Output: Drawing a circle.
        myShape.display(); // Output: This is a shape.
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `Shape` class is abstract and defines an abstract method `draw()`. The `Circle` class provides the implementation for `draw()`. Abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

### Summary Table

| Concept        | Definition                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance** | A class inherits properties and methods from another class.                | `Dog` inherits `eat()` from `Animal`.                                   |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to data.             | `BankAccount` hides `balance` and provides methods to access it.        |
| **Polymorphism** | One interface, multiple implementations.                                   | `Animal` reference can call `sound()` of `Dog` or `Cat` at runtime.    |
| **Abstraction**  | Hiding complex details and showing only essential features.                | `Shape` defines `draw()` but leaves implementation to `Circle`.         |

### Key Points to Remember
- **Inheritance**: Promotes code reuse and establishes a parent-child relationship.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects data by restricting direct access and providing controlled access via methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows flexibility in using objects of different types through a common interface.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.
