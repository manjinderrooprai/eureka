## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. The four main principles of OOP are **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**. Let's break them down with examples:

### 1. **Inheritance**
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

**Example**:
```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal class
        myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog class
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `Dog` class inherits the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. This allows `Dog` to reuse the `eat()` method without rewriting it.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved using **access modifiers** like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.

**Example**:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private attribute

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Public method to get balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.deposit(1000); // Accessing public method
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `balance` attribute is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, it is accessed and modified through public methods (`deposit()` and `getBalance()`). This ensures data integrity and control over how the data is modified.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions. There are two types of polymorphism:
   - **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
   - **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

**Example (Method Overriding)**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Animal object
        Animal myDog = new Dog();      // Dog object
        Animal myCat = new Cat();      // Cat object

        myAnimal.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.sound();    // Output: Dog barks
        myCat.sound();    // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `sound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. Even though the reference type is `Animal`, the actual object type determines which `sound()` method is called at runtime.

### 4. **Abstraction**
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

**Example (Using Abstract Class)**:
```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void draw();

    // Concrete method
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

// Concrete class
class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape myShape = new Circle(); // Upcasting
        myShape.draw();  // Output: Drawing a circle.
        myShape.display(); // Output: This is a shape.
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `Shape` class is abstract and defines an abstract method `draw()`. The `Circle` class provides the implementation for `draw()`. Abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

### Summary Table

| Concept        | Definition                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance** | A class inherits properties and methods from another class.                | `Dog` inherits `eat()` from `Animal`.                                   |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to data.             | `BankAccount` hides `balance` and provides methods to access it.        |
| **Polymorphism** | One interface, multiple implementations.                                   | `Animal` reference can call `sound()` of `Dog` or `Cat` at runtime.    |
| **Abstraction**  | Hiding complex details and showing only essential features.                | `Shape` defines `draw()` but leaves implementation to `Circle`.         |

### Key Points to Remember
- **Inheritance**: Promotes code reuse and establishes a parent-child relationship.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects data by restricting direct access and providing controlled access via methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows flexibility in using objects of different types through a common interface.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.

# Java Collections Framework
The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that provide implementations of commonly used data structures. The three main interfaces in the framework are **List**, **Set**, and **Map**. Each of these interfaces has different characteristics and use cases. Let's break them down and discuss their implementations like **ArrayList**, **HashSet**, and **HashMap**.

### 1. **List**
- **Definition**: A **List** is an ordered collection (also called a sequence). It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order.
- **Key Features**:
  - Elements can be accessed by their index.
  - Allows multiple `null` elements.
  - Common implementations: **ArrayList**, **LinkedList**, **Vector**.

#### **ArrayList**
- **Description**: `ArrayList` is a resizable array implementation of the `List` interface. It provides fast random access and is ideal for scenarios where you need to frequently access elements by their index.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.List;

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
          fruits.add("Apple");  // Add elements
          fruits.add("Banana");
          fruits.add("Orange");

          System.out.println(fruits.get(1)); // Output: Banana (access by index)
          System.out.println(fruits); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange] (maintains order)
      }
  }
  ```
- **When to Use**: Use `ArrayList` when you need fast access to elements by index and don't need to frequently insert or delete elements in the middle of the list.

### 2. **Set**
- **Definition**: A **Set** is a collection that does **not allow duplicate elements**. It does not maintain any order (unless using a specific implementation like `LinkedHashSet` or `TreeSet`).
- **Key Features**:
  - No duplicate elements allowed.
  - Allows at most one `null` element.
  - Common implementations: **HashSet**, **LinkedHashSet**, **TreeSet**.

#### **HashSet**
- **Description**: `HashSet` is a hash table-based implementation of the `Set` interface. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like `add`, `remove`, and `contains`.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  import java.util.HashSet;
  import java.util.Set;

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Set<String> fruits = new HashSet<>();
          fruits.add("Apple");
          fruits.add("Banana");
          fruits.add("Orange");
          fruits.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, will not be added

          System.out.println(fruits); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange] (no duplicates)
      }
  }
  ```
- **When to Use**: Use `HashSet` when you need to store unique elements and do not care about the order of elements.

### 3. **Map**
- **Definition**: A **Map** is a collection that stores key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to exactly one value. Unlike `List` and `Set`, `Map` is not a subtype of the `Collection` interface.
- **Key Features**:
  - Keys are unique, but values can be duplicated.
  - Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.
  - Common implementations: **HashMap**, **LinkedHashMap**, **TreeMap**.

#### **HashMap**
- **Description**: `HashMap` is a hash table-based implementation of the `Map` interface. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like `put`, `get`, and `remove`.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  import java.util.HashMap;
  import java.util.Map;

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Map<String, Integer> fruitPrices = new HashMap<>();
          fruitPrices.put("Apple", 50);  // Add key-value pairs
          fruitPrices.put("Banana", 20);
          fruitPrices.put("Orange", 30);

          System.out.println(fruitPrices.get("Banana")); // Output: 20 (access by key)
          System.out.println(fruitPrices); // Output: {Apple=50, Banana=20, Orange=30}
      }
  }
  ```
- **When to Use**: Use `HashMap` when you need to store key-value pairs and require fast access, insertion, and deletion.

### Comparison Table

| Feature                | **List** (e.g., ArrayList)       | **Set** (e.g., HashSet)       | **Map** (e.g., HashMap)       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Duplicates**         | Allows duplicates               | No duplicates allowed         | Keys are unique, values can be duplicated |
| **Order**              | Maintains insertion order       | No order (unless using `LinkedHashSet` or `TreeSet`) | No order (unless using `LinkedHashMap` or `TreeMap`) |
| **Null Elements**      | Allows multiple `null` elements | Allows at most one `null` element | Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values |
| **Access**             | Access by index                 | No index-based access         | Access by key                 |
| **Common Use Case**    | Ordered collections with duplicates | Unique elements, no order     | Key-value pairs               |

### Key Points to Remember
1. **List**:
   - Ordered collection with duplicates.
   - Use `ArrayList` for fast random access and `LinkedList` for frequent insertions/deletions.

2. **Set**:
   - Unordered collection with no duplicates.
   - Use `HashSet` for general-purpose unique collections and `TreeSet` for sorted unique collections.

3. **Map**:
   - Stores key-value pairs with unique keys.
   - Use `HashMap` for general-purpose key-value storage and `TreeMap` for sorted key-value pairs.

### Common Interview Questions
1. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
   - `ArrayList` is backed by a dynamic array, providing fast random access but slower insertions/deletions in the middle.
   - `LinkedList` is backed by a doubly-linked list, providing fast insertions/deletions but slower random access.

2. **What is the difference between `HashSet` and `TreeSet`?**
   - `HashSet` uses a hash table for storage and does not maintain any order.
   - `TreeSet` uses a Red-Black tree and stores elements in sorted order.

3. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap`?**
   - `HashMap` uses a hash table and does not maintain any order of keys.
   - `TreeMap` uses a Red-Black tree and stores keys in sorted order.

4. **How does `HashMap` handle collisions?**
   - `HashMap` uses **chaining** (linked lists) to handle collisions. In Java 8+, it uses a balanced tree (instead of a linked list) for buckets with a large number of collisions.

# Exception handling

Exception handling is a critical aspect of Java programming. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. Java categorizes exceptions into two main types: **checked exceptions** and **unchecked exceptions**. Let's break down the differences between them and discuss how to handle them.

### 1. **Checked Exceptions**
- **Definition**: Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at **compile-time**. This means the compiler ensures that these exceptions are either caught using a `try-catch` block or declared to be thrown using the `throws` keyword.
- **When to Use**: Checked exceptions are used for scenarios where the program can reasonably anticipate and recover from an exception (e.g., file not found, network issues).
- **Examples**:
  - `IOException` (e.g., file I/O operations)
  - `SQLException` (e.g., database access issues)
  - `ClassNotFoundException` (e.g., class not found during runtime)

#### **Handling Checked Exceptions**
You must either:
1. **Catch the exception** using a `try-catch` block.
2. **Declare the exception** using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("nonexistent.txt"); // Checked exception
            int data = file.read();
            file.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IO error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `FileInputStream` constructor and `read()` method can throw `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`, which are checked exceptions. We handle them using a `try-catch` block.

### 2. **Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Definition**: Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that are **not checked at compile-time**. They occur at runtime and are usually caused by programming errors (e.g., null pointer, array index out of bounds).
- **When to Use**: Unchecked exceptions are used for scenarios that are typically caused by bugs in the code (e.g., logic errors, invalid input).
- **Examples**:
  - `NullPointerException` (e.g., accessing a null object)
  - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (e.g., accessing an array with an invalid index)
  - `ArithmeticException` (e.g., division by zero)

#### **Handling Unchecked Exceptions**
Unchecked exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or declared. However, you can still handle them using a `try-catch` block if needed.

**Example**:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        try {
            System.out.println(numbers[5]); // Unchecked exception (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index out of bounds: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: Accessing `numbers[5]` throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which is an unchecked exception. We handle it using a `try-catch` block.

### Key Differences Between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions

| Feature                  | **Checked Exceptions**                          | **Unchecked Exceptions**                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Checked at Compile-Time** | Yes                                           | No                                           |
| **Caused by**            | External factors (e.g., file not found)        | Programming errors (e.g., null pointer)      |
| **Handling**             | Must be caught or declared using `throws`      | Optional (can be caught but not required)    |
| **Examples**             | `IOException`, `SQLException`                  | `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` |

### Best Practices for Exception Handling
1. **Use Checked Exceptions for Recoverable Errors**:
   - Use checked exceptions when the program can reasonably recover from the error (e.g., retrying a file operation).

2. **Use Unchecked Exceptions for Programming Errors**:
   - Use unchecked exceptions for errors that indicate bugs in the code (e.g., null pointer, invalid input).

3. **Catch Specific Exceptions**:
   - Always catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `Exception` catch block. This makes debugging easier.

4. **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks**:
   - Never leave a catch block empty. At a minimum, log the exception or provide meaningful feedback.

5. **Use Finally for Cleanup**:
   - Use the `finally` block to release resources (e.g., closing files, database connections) regardless of whether an exception occurs.

**Example of `finally` Block**:
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileInputStream file = null;
        try {
            file = new FileInputStream("example.txt");
            int data = file.read();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IO error: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (file != null) {
                    file.close(); // Ensure the file is closed
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error closing file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Interview Questions
1. **What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**
   - Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time and must be handled, while unchecked exceptions occur at runtime and do not need to be explicitly handled.

2. **When should you use checked exceptions vs. unchecked exceptions?**
   - Use checked exceptions for recoverable errors (e.g., file not found) and unchecked exceptions for programming errors (e.g., null pointer).

3. **What is the `finally` block used for?**
   - The `finally` block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurs (e.g., releasing resources).

4. **Can you catch multiple exceptions in a single `catch` block?**
   - Yes, in Java 7+, you can use a multi-catch block:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw exceptions
     } catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
         System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
     }
     ```

# Multithreading
Certainly! Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that allows you to execute multiple threads concurrently, enabling better utilization of CPU resources and improved application performance. Let's break down the basics of **threading**, **synchronization**, and **concurrent collections**.

### 1. **Threading Basics**
A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Java provides built-in support for multithreading through the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.

#### **Creating Threads**
There are two ways to create a thread in Java:
1. **Extending the `Thread` class**:
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread thread = new MyThread();
           thread.start(); // Start the thread
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**:
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
           thread.start(); // Start the thread
       }
   }
   ```

- **Key Points**:
  - The `start()` method begins the execution of the thread, and the JVM calls the `run()` method.
  - Prefer implementing `Runnable` over extending `Thread` because Java does not support multiple inheritance, and `Runnable` is more flexible.

### 2. **Synchronization**
When multiple threads access shared resources, it can lead to **race conditions** (where the output depends on the sequence of thread execution). Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

#### **Synchronized Methods**
You can use the `synchronized` keyword to synchronize methods or blocks of code.

**Example**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Create two threads that increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount()); // Output: 2000
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `increment()` method is synchronized, so only one thread can execute it at a time, preventing race conditions.

#### **Synchronized Blocks**
You can also synchronize specific blocks of code instead of entire methods.

**Example**:
```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized (this) { // Synchronized block
        count++;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Concurrent Collections**
Java provides thread-safe collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package. These collections are optimized for multithreaded environments and eliminate the need for explicit synchronization.

#### **Common Concurrent Collections**
1. **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
   - A thread-safe version of `HashMap`.
   - Allows concurrent read and write operations without locking the entire map.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
           map.put("Apple", 50);
           map.put("Banana", 20);

           System.out.println(map.get("Apple")); // Output: 50
       }
   }
   ```

2. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**:
   - A thread-safe version of `ArrayList`.
   - Creates a new copy of the list whenever it is modified, ensuring thread safety for read operations.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
           list.add("Apple");
           list.add("Banana");

           System.out.println(list); // Output: [Apple, Banana]
       }
   }
   ```

3. **`BlockingQueue`**:
   - A thread-safe queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available when storing an element.
   - Common implementations: `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
   import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           BlockingQueue<String> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
           queue.put("Apple"); // Add to the queue
           String fruit = queue.take(); // Remove from the queue
           System.out.println(fruit); // Output: Apple
       }
   }
   ```

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Threading**:
   - Use `Thread` or `Runnable` to create threads.
   - The `start()` method begins thread execution, and the JVM calls the `run()` method.

2. **Synchronization**:
   - Use `synchronized` methods or blocks to prevent race conditions.
   - Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

3. **Concurrent Collections**:
   - Use `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `BlockingQueue` for thread-safe operations.
   - These collections eliminate the need for explicit synchronization.


### Common Interview Questions
1. **What is the difference between `Thread` and `Runnable`?**
   - `Thread` is a class, while `Runnable` is an interface.
   - Implementing `Runnable` is preferred because Java does not support multiple inheritance.

2. **What is a race condition?**
   - A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.

3. **What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword?**
   - The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute a method or block of code at a time, preventing race conditions.

4. **What is `ConcurrentHashMap`?**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe version of `HashMap` that allows concurrent read and write operations without locking the entire map.

5. **What is a `BlockingQueue`?**
   - A `BlockingQueue` is a thread-safe queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty or for space to become available.
