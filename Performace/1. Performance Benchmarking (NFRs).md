# Performance Benchmarking (NFRs)
## 🧩 **1. What is Performance Benchmarking (NFRs)**

**Performance Benchmarking** refers to **measuring and comparing system performance** against predefined **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** or performance standards.
It ensures the system meets expected performance levels before going live or after major updates.

## ⚙️ **2. What are NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements)?**

Unlike functional requirements (what the system *does*), **NFRs** define **how well** the system performs.

Common **Performance NFRs** include:

| Category                 | Example NFR                                                      | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Response Time**        | “System must respond within 2 seconds for 95% of user requests.” | Time taken for a system to return a result after a request. |
| **Throughput**           | “System must handle 500 transactions per second.”                | Number of operations completed per time unit.               |
| **Scalability**          | “System should scale linearly with increase in users.”           | Ability to handle growth in users/data.                     |
| **Availability**         | “System must maintain 99.9% uptime.”                             | Percentage of time the system remains operational.          |
| **Resource Utilization** | “CPU usage should not exceed 70% under peak load.”               | Efficient use of system resources like CPU, memory, or I/O. |
| **Reliability**          | “System should recover within 5 minutes after a failure.”        | Ability to maintain service continuity.                     |

## 📏 **3. What is Performance Benchmarking?**

It’s the **process of testing, measuring, and comparing** these NFRs against a **baseline or industry standard**.

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Identify Performance KPIs** (response time, TPS, CPU load, etc.)
2. **Define Benchmark Scenarios** (realistic workloads, peak load, failover cases)
3. **Execute Load/Stress Tests**
4. **Capture Metrics**
5. **Compare Results** against:

   * SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
   * Industry standards
   * Previous version baselines

## 📊 **5. Example Benchmark Results Table**

| Metric              | NFR Target | Test Result | Status |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Response Time (p95) | ≤ 2s       | 1.8s        | ✅      |
| Throughput          | ≥ 500 TPS  | 480 TPS     | ⚠️     |
| CPU Utilization     | ≤ 70%      | 65%         | ✅      |
| Memory Usage        | ≤ 4GB      | 5.2GB       | ❌      |

## 🧩 **6. Types of Performance Tests Used for Benchmarking**

| Test Type                    | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Load Testing**             | Check performance under expected workload         |
| **Stress Testing**           | Identify system’s breaking point                  |
| **Spike Testing**            | Evaluate performance during sudden traffic surges |
| **Endurance (Soak) Testing** | Check long-term stability under sustained load    |
| **Scalability Testing**      | Measure performance under increasing load         |

## 🧮 **7. Sample Benchmark Formula**

To calculate **Throughput**:
[
\text{Throughput (TPS)} = \frac{\text{Total number of transactions}}{\text{Total time (in seconds)}}
]

To measure **95th Percentile Response Time**:
Sort all response times and pick the value below which 95% of requests fall.

## 💡 **8. Fun Facts**

* 🚀 Amazon found that **every 100ms delay** in page load time could cost **1% in sales**.
* ⏱️ Google reported that **0.5s delay** leads to **20% drop in traffic**.
* 💸 Performance optimization costs less during development than after release (up to **30x cheaper**).
* ⚙️ Netflix runs **chaos testing** daily to maintain high availability under failure conditions.

## 🏁 **9. Outcome of Performance Benchmarking**

After benchmarking, teams can:

* Validate system readiness against NFRs
* Identify performance bottlenecks
* Plan capacity and scaling strategies
* Establish baselines for future versions
