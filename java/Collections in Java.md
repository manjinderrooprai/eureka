# Collections in Java

### What is Collection in Java?
> A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

### What is a framework in Java?
> A framework provides a ready-made structure of classes and interfaces for building software applications efficiently.

### What is Collection framework
> The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It enhances code efficiency and readability by offering various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables, tailored to different programming needs.
### Advantages of the Java Collection Framework
1. **Reusability:** The framework provides a comprehensive set of common classes and utility methods applicable across various types of collections.
2. **Quality:** Leveraging the Java Collections Framework elevates the quality of programs.
3. **Speed:** Developers often report an increase in development speed when using the Collections Framework.
4. **Maintenance:** The open-source nature of the Java Collections Framework, coupled with readily available API documentation, facilitates easier code maintenance.
5. **Reduces Effort to Design New APIs:** An additional benefit is the reduced necessity for API designers and implementers to create new collection mechanisms for each new API.

### Hierarchy of Collection Framework

- **Class:** A class is a **blueprint from which individual objects are created.** It encapsulates data for objects through fields (attributes) and defines behavior via methods.
- **Interface:** An interface is a reference type in Java that can **contain constants and abstract methods (methods without a body).** Interfaces **specify what a class must do but not how it does it,** enforcing a set of methods that the class must implement.
