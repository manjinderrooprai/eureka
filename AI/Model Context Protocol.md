# MCP: Model Context Protocol

### Real Problem with AI Implementation:

AI agents can write code, summarize reports, even chat like humans but when it’s time to actually do something in the real world, they stall, because most of the tools still need clunky, one-off integrations.

### Solution:

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** changes that. It gives AI agents a simple, standardized way to plug into tools, data, and services — no hacks, no hand-coding.

## What is MCP?
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open standard developed by Anthropic**, the company behind **Claude**.
- It gives AI agents a consistent way to connect with tools, services, and data — no matter where they live or how they’re built.
- MCP is a big leap forward in how AI agents operate.
- Instead of just answering questions, agents can now perform useful, multi-step tasks — like retrieving data, summarizing documents, or saving content to a file.
- With MCP, it’s plug-and-play. Agents can send structured requests to any MCP-compatible tool, get results back in real time, and even chain multiple tools together — without needing to know the specifics ahead of time.

**NOTE:** Before MCP, each of those actions required a unique API, custom logic, and developer time to glue it all together.

#### How MCP works under the hood:

- MCP Host (on the left) is the AI-powered app — for example, Claude Desktop, an IDE, or another tool acting as an agent.
- The host connects to multiple MCP Servers, each one exposing a different tool or resource.
- Some servers access local resources (like a file system or database on your computer).
- Others can reach out to remote resources (like APIs or cloud services on the internet).

**NOTE:** All communication between host and servers happens over the standardized MCP Protocol, which ensures compatibility and structured responses.

### MCP Servers

An MCP server is like a smart adapter for a tool or app. It knows how to take a request from an AI (like “Get today’s sales report”) and translate it into the commands that tool understands.

**For Example:**

- A GitHub MCP server might turn “list my open pull requests” into a GitHub API call.
- A File MCP server might take “save this summary as a text file” and write it to your desktop.
- A YouTube MCP server could transcribe video links on demand.

**MCP servers also can perform:**
- Tell the AI what they can do (tool discovery)
- Interpret and run commands
- Format results the AI can understand
- Handle errors and give meaningful feedback

### MCP Clients

On the other side, an MCP client lives inside the AI assistant or app (like Claude or Cursor). When the AI wants to use a tool, it goes through this client to talk to the matching server.

The client handles all the back-and-forth — sending requests, receiving results, and passing them to the AI.

**For example:**

- Cursor can use a client to interact with your local development environment.
- Claude might use it to access files or read from a spreadsheet.
