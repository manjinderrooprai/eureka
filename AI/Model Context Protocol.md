### Real Problem with AI Implementation:

AI agents can write code, summarize reports, even chat like humans but when it’s time to actually do something in the real world, they stall, because most of the tools still need clunky, one-off integrations.

### Solution:

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** changes that. It gives AI agents a simple, standardized way to plug into tools, data, and services — no hacks, no hand-coding.
