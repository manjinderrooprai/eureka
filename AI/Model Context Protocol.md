# MCP: Model Context Protocol

### Real Problem with AI Implementation:

AI agents can write code, summarize reports, even chat like humans but when it’s time to actually do something in the real world, they stall, because most of the tools still need clunky, one-off integrations.

### Solution:

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** changes that. It gives AI agents a simple, standardized way to plug into tools, data, and services — no hacks, no hand-coding.

### What is MCP?
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic, the company behind Claude.
- It gives AI agents a consistent way to connect with tools, services, and data — no matter where they live or how they’re built.
- MCP is a big leap forward in how AI agents operate.
- Instead of just answering questions, agents can now perform useful, multi-step tasks — like retrieving data, summarizing documents, or saving content to a file.
- With MCP, it’s plug-and-play. Agents can send structured requests to any MCP-compatible tool, get results back in real time, and even chain multiple tools together — without needing to know the specifics ahead of time.

**NOTE:** Before MCP, each of those actions required a unique API, custom logic, and developer time to glue it all together.

#### How MCP works under the hood:

- MCP Host (on the left) is the AI-powered app — for example, Claude Desktop, an IDE, or another tool acting as an agent.
- The host connects to multiple MCP Servers, each one exposing a different tool or resource.
- Some servers access local resources (like a file system or database on your computer).
- Others can reach out to remote resources (like APIs or cloud services on the internet).

**NOTE:** All communication between host and servers happens over the standardized MCP Protocol, which ensures compatibility and structured responses.
