# Model Context Protocol

### Real Problem with AI Implementation:

AI agents can write code, summarize reports, even chat like humans but when it’s time to actually do something in the real world, they stall, because most of the tools still need clunky, one-off integrations.

### Solution:

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** changes that. It gives AI agents a simple, standardized way to plug into tools, data, and services — no hacks, no hand-coding.

## What is MCP?

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open standard developed by Anthropic**, the company behind **Claude**.
- It gives AI agents a consistent way to connect with tools, services, and data — no matter where they live or how they’re built.
- MCP is a big leap forward in how AI agents operate.
- Instead of just answering questions, agents can now perform useful, multi-step tasks — like retrieving data, summarizing documents, or saving content to a file.
- With MCP, it’s plug-and-play. Agents can send structured requests to any MCP-compatible tool, get results back in real time, and even chain multiple tools together — without needing to know the specifics ahead of time.

**NOTE:** Before MCP, each of those actions required a unique API, custom logic, and developer time to glue it all together.

#### How MCP works under the hood:

- MCP Host (on the left) is the AI-powered app — for example, Claude Desktop, an IDE, or another tool acting as an agent.
- The host connects to multiple MCP Servers, each one exposing a different tool or resource.
- Some servers access local resources (like a file system or database on your computer).
- Others can reach out to remote resources (like APIs or cloud services on the internet).

**NOTE:** All communication between host and servers happens over the standardized MCP Protocol, which ensures compatibility and structured responses.

### MCP Servers

An MCP server is like a smart adapter for a tool or app. It knows how to take a request from an AI (like “Get today’s sales report”) and translate it into the commands that tool understands.

**For Example:**

- A GitHub MCP server might turn “list my open pull requests” into a GitHub API call.
- A File MCP server might take “save this summary as a text file” and write it to your desktop.
- A YouTube MCP server could transcribe video links on demand.

**MCP servers also can perform:**

- Tell the AI what they can do (tool discovery)
- Interpret and run commands
- Format results the AI can understand
- Handle errors and give meaningful feedback

### MCP Clients

On the other side, an MCP client lives inside the AI assistant or app (like Claude or Cursor). When the AI wants to use a tool, it goes through this client to talk to the matching server.

The client handles all the back-and-forth — sending requests, receiving results, and passing them to the AI.

**For example:**

- Cursor can use a client to interact with your local development environment.
- Claude might use it to access files or read from a spreadsheet.

### The MCP Protocol

The MCP protocol is what keeps everything in sync. It defines how the client and server communicate — what the messages look like, how actions are described, and how results are returned.

**It’s super flexible:**

- Can run locally (e.g., between your AI and your computer’s apps)
- Can run over the internet (e.g., between your AI and an online tool)
- Uses structured formats like JSON so everything stays clean and consistent

**Thanks to this shared protocol**, an AI agent can connect with a new tool — even one it’s never seen before — and still understand how to use it.

### Services

**Services = Real Apps and Data** - The last part of the puzzle is the services — the actual tools or data sources the AI wants to use. MCP servers are the gateway to these services, handling access securely and reliably.

**These could be:**

- **Local:** files on your device, a folder, an app running locally
- **Remote:** cloud databases, SaaS tools, web APIs

### Who’s Already Using MCP?

1. **Block** is using MCP to hook up internal tools and knowledge sources to AI agents.
2. **Replit** integrated MCP so agents can read and write code across files, terminals, and projects.
3. **Apollo** is using MCP to let AI pull from structured data sources.
4. **Sourcegraph** and Codeium are plugging it into dev workflows for smarter code assistance.
5. **Microsoft Copilot Studio** now supports MCP too — making it easier for non-developers to connect AI to data and tools, no coding required.

### Marketplaces:

- **mcpmarket.com** — A plug-and-play directory of MCP servers for tools like GitHub, Figma, Notion, Databricks, and more.
- **mcp.so **— A growing open repo of community-built MCP servers. Discover one. Fork it. Build your own.
- **Cline’s MCP Marketplace** — A GitHub-powered hub for open-source MCP connectors anyone can use.

### Infra Tools Are Making MCP Even Easier:

Behind the scenes, a bunch of companies are helping developers build, host, and manage MCP servers with way less effort:

- **Mintlify, Stainless, Speakeasy** → auto-generate servers with just a few clicks
- **Cloudflare, Smithery** → make hosting and scaling production-grade servers simple
- **Toolbase** → handles key management and routing for local-first setups
