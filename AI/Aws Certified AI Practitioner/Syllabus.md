    3. Model is deployed using **SageMaker endpoint inside a VPC** (via **PrivateLink**)
    4. Credentials (e.g., for downstream APIs) stored in **Secrets Manager**
    5. **Macie** continuously monitors S3 for sensitive data exposure

* ### Security principles:
  * Encryption (at rest/in-transit), data integrity, threat detection
    **Security in AI Systems** with a special focus on:
    ### ‚úÖ 1. **Encryption**
    Encryption ensures **confidentiality of data and models**, both during storage (at rest) and during transfer (in transit).
    
    #### üîπ **Encryption at Rest**
    * Protects data stored in **S3, EBS, SageMaker notebooks/models**, etc.
    * AWS uses **AES-256** and **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**.
    * You can use **AWS-managed keys** or **Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)**.
    
    **Examples:**
    * Encrypt S3 buckets storing training data using **KMS**.
    * Encrypt EBS volumes used by SageMaker notebook instances.
    * Enable model artifact encryption during training jobs.
    
    #### üîπ **Encryption in Transit**
    * Protects data when moving between components (e.g., client ‚Üî API, SageMaker ‚Üî S3).
    * AWS uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.
    
    **Examples:**
    * Secure prediction requests to SageMaker endpoints using **HTTPS**.
    * Use **VPC endpoints + PrivateLink** to route traffic privately.
      
    ### ‚úÖ 2. **Data Integrity**
    Ensures **data has not been altered** maliciously or accidentally.
    
    #### üîπ AWS Security Practices
    | Practice                     | Tool/Service                               |
    | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    | **S3 Versioning**            | Track and restore previous data versions   |
    | **Checksums**                | Used to verify file integrity (MD5, SHA)   |
    | **CloudTrail**               | Logs API activity for auditing data access |
    | **KMS with Signed Requests** | Ensures authenticity of users and actions  |
    
    **Examples:**
    * Enable versioning for training datasets in S3.
    * Log access to training/inference data using CloudTrail.
    
    ### ‚úÖ 3. **Threat Detection**
    Helps identify **unauthorized access or unusual behavior**.
    
    #### üîπ Tools for Threat Detection
    | Service                         | Role in Threat Detection                                                          |
    | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Amazon Macie**                | Detects PII in datasets automatically                                             |
    | **Amazon GuardDuty**            | Detects anomalies in AWS accounts (e.g., data exfiltration, suspicious API calls) |
    | **AWS CloudTrail + CloudWatch** | Audit trails + real-time alerts                                                   |
    | **AWS Config**                  | Continuously monitors resource compliance                                         |
    
    **Example Threat Scenarios:**
    * Macie alerts you to unencrypted S3 bucket with PII
    * GuardDuty detects an unusual access pattern to SageMaker endpoint
    * CloudWatch triggers an alert when someone accesses SageMaker model from an unusual IP
