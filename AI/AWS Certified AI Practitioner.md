Of course. Here is a summary of the key information from the AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) exam guide to help you prepare.

### Who is this Exam For?

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam is designed for individuals who have a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and generative AI technologies, along with the related AWS services.

* **Target Candidate**: The ideal candidate has about **six months of exposure** to AI/ML technologies on AWS.
* **Role Focus**: This certification is for those who **use** AI/ML solutions, not necessarily for those who build, code, or develop them.

### Exam Structure and Scoring

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect on exam day:

* **Total Questions**: The exam consists of 65 questions, but only **50 of these will affect your score**. The remaining 15 are unscored questions used by AWS for evaluation purposes.
* **Question Formats**: You can expect a variety of question types:
    * **Multiple choice**: One correct answer.
    * **Multiple response**: Two or more correct answers. You must select all correct options to get credit.
    * **Ordering**: Place responses in the correct sequence.
    * **Matching**: Pair prompts with the correct responses.
    * **Case study**: A scenario followed by two or more related questions.
* **Passing Score**: The exam is scored on a scale of 100 to 1,000, and the **minimum passing score is 700**.
* **Scoring Model**: The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, meaning you only need to pass the overall exam, not every individual section.

### Exam Content and Domains

The exam content is divided into five key domains, each with a specific weighting toward your final score.

| Domain | Weighting | Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain 1: Fundamentals of Al and ML** | 20% | Defines basic concepts like AI, ML, deep learning, and neural networks. It also covers the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and the stages of the ML development lifecycle. |
| **Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative Al** | 24% | Covers foundational generative AI concepts such as LLMs, foundation models, prompt engineering, and embeddings. It assesses your ability to identify use cases and understand the lifecycle of foundation models. |
| **Domain 3: Applications of Foundation Models** | 28% | Focuses on design considerations like choosing pre-trained models and using techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It also covers prompt engineering techniques and the process of fine-tuning models. |
| **Domain 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI** | 14% | Tests your knowledge of responsible AI principles, including fairness, bias, inclusivity, and safety. It includes understanding how to detect bias and the importance of transparent models. |
| **Domain 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions** | 14% | Covers methods for securing AI systems using AWS services. It also includes knowledge of data governance strategies and regulatory compliance standards relevant to AI. |

### What You Are NOT Expected to Know

The exam guide explicitly lists several advanced tasks that are **out of scope** for the target candidate. You are **not** expected to be able to perform the following:

* Developing or coding AI/ML models or algorithms.
* Implementing data or feature engineering techniques.
* Performing hyperparameter tuning.
* Building and deploying AI/ML pipelines or infrastructure.
* Conducting deep mathematical or statistical analysis of models.

The appendix of the guide provides a detailed list of in-scope and out-of-scope AWS services. Key in-scope services include Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Lex.
