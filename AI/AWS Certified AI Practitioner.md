Of course. Here is a summary of the key information from the AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) exam guide to help you prepare.

### Who is this Exam For?

[cite_start]The AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam is designed for individuals who have a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and generative AI technologies, along with the related AWS services[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]**Target Candidate**: The ideal candidate has about **six months of exposure** to AI/ML technologies on AWS[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Role Focus**: This certification is for those who **use** AI/ML solutions, not necessarily for those who build, code, or develop them[cite: 7, 10].

### Exam Structure and Scoring

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect on exam day:

* [cite_start]**Total Questions**: The exam consists of 65 questions, but only **50 of these will affect your score**[cite: 23]. [cite_start]The remaining 15 are unscored questions used by AWS for evaluation purposes[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Question Formats**: You can expect a variety of question types[cite: 11]:
    * [cite_start]**Multiple choice**: One correct answer. [cite: 11]
    * **Multiple response**: Two or more correct answers. [cite_start]You must select all correct options to get credit[cite: 12, 13].
    * [cite_start]**Ordering**: Place responses in the correct sequence[cite: 14, 15].
    * [cite_start]**Matching**: Pair prompts with the correct responses[cite: 16, 17].
    * [cite_start]**Case study**: A scenario followed by two or more related questions[cite: 18, 19].
* [cite_start]**Passing Score**: The exam is scored on a scale of 100 to 1,000, and the **minimum passing score is 700**[cite: 27, 28].
* [cite_start]**Scoring Model**: The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, meaning you only need to pass the overall exam, not every individual section[cite: 31, 32].

### Exam Content and Domains

[cite_start]The exam content is divided into five key domains, each with a specific weighting toward your final score[cite: 39].

| Domain | Weighting | Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain 1: Fundamentals of Al and ML** | 20% | [cite_start]Defines basic concepts like AI, ML, deep learning, and neural networks[cite: 40]. [cite_start]It also covers the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning [cite: 43][cite_start], and the stages of the ML development lifecycle[cite: 50]. |
| **Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative Al** | 24% | [cite_start]Covers foundational generative AI concepts such as LLMs, foundation models, prompt engineering, and embeddings[cite: 58]. [cite_start]It assesses your ability to identify use cases and understand the lifecycle of foundation models[cite: 59, 60, 61]. |
| **Domain 3: Applications of Foundation Models** | 28% | [cite_start]Focuses on design considerations like choosing pre-trained models and using techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)[cite: 73, 76]. [cite_start]It also covers prompt engineering techniques and the process of fine-tuning models[cite: 81, 85]. |
| **Domain 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI** | 14% | [cite_start]Tests your knowledge of responsible AI principles, including fairness, bias, inclusivity, and safety[cite: 94, 95]. [cite_start]It includes understanding how to detect bias and the importance of transparent models[cite: 100, 102]. |
| **Domain 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions** | 14% | [cite_start]Covers methods for securing AI systems using AWS services[cite: 107]. [cite_start]It also includes knowledge of data governance strategies and regulatory compliance standards relevant to AI[cite: 112, 115]. |

### What You Are NOT Expected to Know

The exam guide explicitly lists several advanced tasks that are **out of scope** for the target candidate. [cite_start]You are **not** expected to be able to perform the following[cite: 10]:

* Developing or coding AI/ML models or algorithms.
* Implementing data or feature engineering techniques.
* Performing hyperparameter tuning.
* Building and deploying AI/ML pipelines or infrastructure.
* Conducting deep mathematical or statistical analysis of models.

[cite_start]The appendix of the guide provides a detailed list of in-scope and out-of-scope AWS services[cite: 118, 124]. [cite_start]Key in-scope services include Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Lex[cite: 121].
