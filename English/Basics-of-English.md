# Basics of English grammar

Let's start with the basics of English grammar step by step.  

## 1. **Parts of Speech**  
English grammar is based on eight parts of speech:  

1. **Noun** – Names a person, place, thing, or idea.  
   - Example: *dog, city, happiness*  
2. **Pronoun** – Replaces a noun.  
   - Example: *he, she, they, it*  
3. **Verb** – Shows an action or state of being.  
   - Example: *run, jump, is, was*  
4. **Adjective** – Describes a noun or pronoun.  
   - Example: *beautiful, tall, red*  
5. **Adverb** – Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb.  
   - Example: *quickly, very, well*  
6. **Preposition** – Shows a relationship between a noun/pronoun and another word.  
   - Example: *in, on, at, under*  
7. **Conjunction** – Connects words, phrases, or clauses.  
   - Example: *and, but, or, because*  
8. **Interjection** – Expresses emotion.  
   - Example: *Wow!, Oh!, Ouch!*  

## 2. **Sentence Structure**  
A basic sentence has:  
- **Subject** (who/what the sentence is about)  
- **Verb** (what the subject does)  
- **Object** (who/what receives the action)  

Example:  
- *John (subject) eats (verb) an apple (object).*  

### Types of Sentences  
1. **Declarative** (statement) – "She likes coffee."  
2. **Interrogative** (question) – "Do you like coffee?"  
3. **Imperative** (command) – "Drink your coffee."  
4. **Exclamatory** (strong feeling) – "Wow, this coffee is amazing!"  

## 3. **Tenses**  
Tenses show the time of an action.  

| Tense          | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Present**   | I eat.  |
| **Past**      | I ate.  |
| **Future**    | I will eat. |

Each tense has **simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous** forms.  

Example in Present Tense:  
- **Simple:** I eat.  
- **Continuous:** I am eating.  
- **Perfect:** I have eaten.  
- **Perfect Continuous:** I have been eating.  

## 4. **Articles**  
- **A / An** (Indefinite articles) – Used for general things. (*a cat, an apple*)  
- **The** (Definite article) – Used for specific things. (*the sun, the book*)  

## 5. **Subject-Verb Agreement**  
The subject and verb must agree in number (singular/plural).  
- **Correct:** She *likes* ice cream.  
- **Incorrect:** She *like* ice cream.  

## 6. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**  
1. **Wrong use of tenses** – "I go to the market yesterday." (❌ Incorrect)  
   - "I went to the market yesterday." (✔ Correct)  

2. **Misplacing adjectives/adverbs** – "She speaks English good." (❌ Incorrect)  
   - "She speaks English well." (✔ Correct)  

3. **Using ‘their’ instead of ‘there’** – "Their is a book on the table." (❌ Incorrect)  
   - "There is a book on the table." (✔ Correct)
