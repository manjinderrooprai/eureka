### üîç **NFRs ‚Äì Non-Functional Requirements**

These are requirements that define **how** a system performs rather than **what** it does. They are critical to ensure the **quality**, **scalability**, **security**, and **usability** of the system.

Common NFRs include:

* **Performance**
* **Security**
* **Scalability**
* **Reliability**
* **Maintainability**
* **Usability**

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **SAST ‚Äì Static Application Security Testing**

* Also known as **white-box testing**.
* It analyzes your **source code or binaries** for security vulnerabilities **without executing** the program.
* Helps identify issues like:

  * SQL injection
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  * Insecure code patterns
* Tools: **SonarQube, Fortify, Checkmarx, Veracode, CodeQL**

**Example**: Running a SAST scan on your Java codebase before deploying to catch insecure coding practices early.

### üîì **DAST ‚Äì Dynamic Application Security Testing**

* Also known as **black-box testing**.
* It analyzes the **running application** for security vulnerabilities **at runtime**.
* Simulates real-world attacks like:

  * Broken authentication
  * Input validation flaws
  * Security misconfigurations
* Tools: **OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Netsparker**

**Example**: Running DAST tests against your deployed staging environment to see if it can be hacked from outside.

### üöÄ **Performance Benchmarking**

* Measures how your application **performs under various conditions** (load, stress, concurrency).
* Helps determine:

  * Response time
  * Throughput
  * Resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.)
* Tools: **JMeter, Gatling, Locust, k6**

**Example**: Simulating 5000 concurrent users to test if your app still responds within acceptable time limits.

You‚Äôre expected to focus on 3 critical NFRs:

* ‚úÖ **SAST** ‚Äì Secure code before deployment
* ‚úÖ **DAST** ‚Äì Detect vulnerabilities in running apps
* ‚úÖ **Performance Benchmarking** ‚Äì Ensure responsiveness and scalability
