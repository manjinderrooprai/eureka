## üß∞ Tech Stack (Recommended & Justified)

| Tech                                                 | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Beckn Protocol**                                   | To build an interoperable network of rural clinics, pharmacies, doctors, and transport providers (for mobile clinics). Ensures every participant can discover and transact across services. |
| **Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric / Polygon)**        | Used to securely store patient medical history, prescriptions, and health visits for tamper-proof recordkeeping accessible across clinics.                                                  |
| **AI/ML**                                            | Symptom checker chatbot using NLP (Hugging Face / spaCy). Model suggests care pathways based on triage logic.                                                                               |
| **Computer Vision**                                  | OCR model (Tesseract + OpenCV) to digitize handwritten prescriptions & health cards.                                                                                                        |
| **Cloud Native (Kubernetes + Docker)**               | Microservices-based backend deployed on EKS or GKE; each service (auth, consult, schedule, pharmacy) runs independently and scales based on need.                                           |
| **Frontend (React + Tailwind)**                      | Clean, mobile-first progressive web app for health workers and patients.                                                                                                                    |
| **Video API (Daily.co / WebRTC)**                    | Lightweight telemedicine platform for doctor-patient consults.                                                                                                                              |
| **Data Storage (PostgreSQL + IPFS for attachments)** | Structured storage of patient and provider data; files like scans or prescriptions on IPFS for decentralization.                                                                            |
| **Notifications (Firebase + Twilio)**                | Send SMS/WhatsApp reminders for medication, visits, etc.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Analytics Dashboard (Grafana + Prometheus)**       | For public health officials to monitor region-wise service coverage, top diseases, etc.                                                                                                     |
