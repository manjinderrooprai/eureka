# ✅ NEW CONNECTOR STRATEGY (No ServiceNow Required)

### We will use connectors that:

✔ Everyone can configure
✔ Do not require enterprise licenses
✔ Work immediately
✔ Still provide a realistic onboarding experience

---

# 🎯 UPDATED CONNECTOR SET FOR YOUR HR APP

## 1️⃣ **Microsoft Outlook Connector** (Highly Recommended)

Use it for:

* Sending onboarding emails
* Sending welcome letters
* Scheduling onboarding meetings (IT orientation, HR intro)

This alone makes your onboarding system "real".

✓ Easy to configure
✓ Works with any Microsoft 365 account
✓ High-value demo impact

---

## 2️⃣ **Slack OR Microsoft Teams Connector** (Optional but very impactful)

Use it for:

* Sending onboarding notifications to managers
* Alerting IT team
* Sending candidate updates

This replicates real corporate communication.

✓ Easy
✓ Looks very enterprise-level

---

## 3️⃣ **Google Drive or Box Connector** (Recommended for onboarding documents)

Use it for:

* Storing onboarding documents
* Storing ID card forms
* Storing offer letters
* Retrieving templates

✓ Universal
✓ No enterprise license required
✓ Makes your app look like a real onboarding workflow

---

# 🚫 Removed: **ServiceNow Connector**

Since you don’t have access, we will:

* NOT create real IT tickets
* NOT integrate with workflow engines

Instead, we will **simulate tickets internally**.

But here is the trick:

### Your Onboarding Agent will use connectors to:

✔ Send an onboarding email (via Outlook)
✔ Share onboarding documents (via Drive/Box)
✔ Notify manager (via Slack/Teams)

And internally create a simulated ticket:

```
TICKET-001: Laptop request for Arjun Mehta  
STATUS: Open  
ASSIGNED TO: IT Team  
DUE: 12 Dec 2025
```

This is **perfect for hackathon** and still looks realistic.
