# 🏥 SwasthyaSetu – Smart Rural Healthcare Network

**An open-source platform to bridge the rural healthcare gap in India using AI, Blockchain, Cloud-Native tools, and Beckn Protocol.**  
Developed for the **Infosys Global Hackathon 2025 – Tech for Good**

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Over 65% of India’s population resides in rural areas, where access to quality healthcare remains a major challenge. SwasthyaSetu aims to connect rural patients, community health workers, and urban doctors through a decentralized, interoperable network to enable:

- Remote doctor consultations
- Health worker visit scheduling
- Digital prescription delivery
- Pharmacy integrations
- Patient health records on blockchain

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **Ensure accessible healthcare** for underprivileged rural populations
- **Leverage open protocols** and scalable technologies for interoperability
- **Create tamper-proof medical histories** using blockchain
- **Enable low-bandwidth access** for telemedicine services
