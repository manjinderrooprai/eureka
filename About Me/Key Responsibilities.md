# **Key Responsibilities in Current Role **

In my current role as a **Specialist Programmer at Infosys**, working for **Apple (Peloton – Apple Online Store)**, I am responsible for end-to-end ownership of software development, cloud engineering, DevOps automation, production stability, cross-team coordination, and infrastructure optimization. I work across the complete lifecycle of enterprise-scale applications—from requirement gathering and solution design to implementation, deployment, monitoring, and performance tuning. My role requires strong technical depth in **Java, Spring Boot, AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD**, and a high degree of accountability for critical production systems supporting Apple’s internal engineering teams.

A major part of my responsibility includes **designing, developing, and maintaining multiple Spring Boot microservices** within the Peloton ecosystem. I am involved in building and enhancing modules such as **AWS Inventory, Process Inventory, Packages-Mismatch, EKS Binary Comparison, Binary Comparison, Splunk Integration, AWS Summary, and Environment Health dashboards**. These services are used heavily by internal Apple teams to monitor, troubleshoot, and manage infrastructure health across globally deployed systems. I am accountable for ensuring these services remain highly performant, scalable, and compliant with Apple’s engineering standards.

One of my most impactful responsibilities has been the **automation of deployments for three major Apple applications on Amazon EKS**. I independently built complete end-to-end deployment automation—from infrastructure provisioning, cluster setup, node configuration, IAM roles, VPC components, and service mesh integration to final application rollout. This automation is now used by multiple teams to achieve **one-click, repeatable, and fully reliable deployments** across environments. This initiative not only reduced manual effort but significantly improved release velocity and minimized deployment risks.

I am also responsible for **Dev, Test, UAT, and Production deployments** across multiple services. I coordinate with SRE, QA, product managers, architects, and infrastructure teams to ensure smooth, timely, and error-free releases. As the **single point of contact** for many deployment activities, I provide continuous support, resolve blockers, and maintain release calendars to avoid environment conflicts. My responsibilities include validating build integrity, managing deployment scripts, verifying post-deployment health, and ensuring complete traceability of changes.

A key part of my role is **monitoring system performance, debugging issues, and ensuring long-term stability** of all Peloton services. I utilize tools like **Splunk, Roadrunner, Coyote, Hazelcast, Redis, ActiveMQ, and Narratives** to track runtime behavior, memory usage, system latency, and API dependencies. I perform in-depth **root cause analysis** for production incidents, document findings, implement fixes, and introduce preventive measures to avoid recurrence. My contributions have consistently reduced production downtime and improved system reliability across the Peloton ecosystem.

During my **onsite assignment at Apple’s Burnaby office (March 2023 – September 2024)**, I was responsible for working directly with Apple engineers to gather infrastructure and application requirements. I provided technical guidance on deployment automation, EKS operations, monitoring enhancements, and best practices for Spring Boot and AWS integrations. I led multiple in-person technical discussions, design sessions, and knowledge-transfer workshops, providing architectural recommendations and helping teams refine operational workflows. My onsite engagement strengthened collaboration between Infosys and Apple, and I became the go-to person for several cloud and deployment-related initiatives.

Additionally, I maintain responsibility for **build and environment health**, ensuring UAT and QA cycles run smoothly. I actively monitor UAT processes, resolve environment issues, support testers in debugging, and ensure that application builds flow correctly from Dev to Test to Production. This includes coordinating with external interfacing teams whose systems contribute to integrated workflows.

I also develop and maintain **AWS-related internal tools** used across Apple’s DevOps ecosystem—such as the **Peloton AWS Service Client (PASC)** for standardized AWS SDK interactions, the **Peloton AOS Client Service (PACS)** for EKS communications, the **AWS Cost Report Generator (ACRG)** for automated AWS account cost insights, and **Peloton Monitoring (PM)** for real-time performance dashboards. Each of these tools contributes to improved visibility, operational efficiency, and decision-making for engineering teams.

Beyond development and DevOps, I am responsible for **documentation, compliance, and process optimization**. I maintain detailed technical documentation for services, deployment strategies, infrastructure components, and automation scripts. I also evaluate system workflows to assess business impact and recommend enhancements aligned with organizational goals. My continuous focus on quality ensures that all deliverables adhere to coding conventions, security guidelines, and Apple’s internal audit standards.

I mentor junior developers and new team members, guiding them on Spring Boot development, Kubernetes concepts, AWS usage patterns, debugging strategies, and CI/CD fundamentals. I conduct walkthroughs on complex modules, review code for maintainability and performance, and encourage best practices across the team. This has contributed to smoother onboarding, stronger technical capability within the team, and overall improvement in code quality.

Security and compliance are also critical parts of my responsibilities. I work with tools such as **HashiCorp Vault, Apple Whisper, and Apple Narrative** to ensure secure handling of secrets, environment properties, and access policies. I also integrate unit testing (JUnit, Mockito), static analysis (SonarQube), and vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure compliant and production-ready releases.

Overall, my role demands end-to-end ownership, technical leadership, strong communication, and the ability to manage large-scale, complex, cloud-native systems. I operate at the intersection of development, DevOps, infrastructure, and cross-team collaboration—ensuring that mission-critical systems remain optimized, automated, and highly available for Apple’s engineering ecosystem.
